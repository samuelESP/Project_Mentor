- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

 I had a hard time trying to make things right with the Tag **picture**. So I decided to try something new, so I used two images, while one of them is display: Block and the other is display: none.



```html
<div class="img">

    <picture>

          <img src="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="Image Product Desktop" class="gone">

          <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="" class="mobile">

    </picture>

</div>
```
```css

.img .mobile{ /*Mobile in desktop resolution*/
    display: none;
}
.img .mobile{/*Mobile in own resolution*/
        width: 100%;
        display: block;
    }

    
.img .gone{/*Desktop in mobile resolution*/
        display: none;
    }/*Desktop is the primary resolution*/
```


### Continued development

As I had problems with the **picture** tag I will train a little more about it and responsive images.
